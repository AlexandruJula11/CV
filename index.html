            <p>
              By being paired with another newcomer, I learnt how to perform in a work environment
              and to write tests in a python framework (ROBOT) in order to
              check the fault management.

              As part of a team which ran campaigns of tests in order to verify the KPIs of 2G from
              different releases and updated the software to make it work as
              required, I contributed to the development of 3 scripts in
              ROBOT, PowerShell and cmd, in order to speed-up the run of tests
              procedures.

              Until now, it helped to widen my informatics skills by learning the
              functional programming basic concepts in OCAML and Lisp, to take the
              first steps in Java(what is OOP) and to deepen the C/C++ language by
              solving computer science problems.</br></br> Last year, I learnt more about C#
              while developing a FPS in Unity3D. </br></br>

              I had to write test cases using a webdriver in Java - Selenium library to test end user
              functionalities(if click events work, if the data is fetched, loaded correctly),page
              view (html elements, css classes, properties).

            <p>
              As one of the top of hometown highschools at that time, it helped me
              to improve in mathematics by having multiple qualifications in the
              Regional phases of The National Mathematical Olympiad and to pursue
              a career in the IT field by learning the informatics foundations:
              C++ as the starting programming language, SQL and the Microsoft
              Office softwares.
